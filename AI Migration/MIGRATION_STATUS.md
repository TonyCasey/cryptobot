## 🔧 **REMAINING ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### 1. **Complete Core Migration** 🟡
**Task**: Migrate CryptoBot.Core project to .NET 8
- **Status**: **READY** - All dependencies (IndicatorEngine, ExchangeEngine) now resolved
- **Expected Issues**: Configuration migration, dependency injection changes
- **Priority**: HIGH - Unlocks remaining projects (Console, BackTester, Tests)

### ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### ~~1. TALib.NETCore API Research~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Updated to TALib.NETCore v0.5.0 
- ✅ Fixed MACD: `Core.Macd(...)` → `Functions.Macd(...)`
- ✅ Fixed Stochastic: `Core.Stoch(...)` → `Functions.Stoch(...)`
- ✅ IndicatorEngine builds successfully

### ~~2. RestSharp v111 Breaking Changes~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Replaced `RestSharp.Extensions.MonoHttp` with `System.Net.WebUtility`
- ✅ Updated HTTP methods and async patterns
- ✅ Upgraded to secure RestSharp v111.4.1

### ~~3. WebSocket Replacement~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**  
- ✅ Already using `System.Net.WebSockets.ClientWebSocket`
- ✅ No WebSocketSharp dependencies found
- ✅ Modern WebSocket implementation in place

### ~~4. API Versioning Migration~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Added `using Asp.Versioning;` to all controllers
- ✅ Fixed `IHostingEnvironment` ambiguous reference
- ✅ `ApiVersionAttribute` now recognized

### ~~5. ExchangeTicker Type Resolution~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Fixed missing ExchangeTicker → Updated interface to use `Ticker` from Model
- ✅ Updated ExchangeTrade → `Trade`, MarketCandle → `Candle` 
- ✅ Added proper using statements for Model.Domain.Market and Trading

### ~~6. Interface Implementation Conflicts~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

## 📈 **NEXT STEPS PRIORITY**

1. **🟡 HIGH** - Migrate CryptoBot.Core project to .NET 8
2. **🟡 MEDIUM** - Re-enable project references in API project
3. **🔵 LOW** - Migrate Console, BackTester, Tests projects
4. **🔵 LOW** - Address .NET 8 security warnings (cryptography obsolete methods)

### **Immediate Actions Needed:**
- [x] ~~Investigate ExchangeTicker class location/definition~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] ~~Fix interface conflicts between Model and ExchangeEngine~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**  
- [x] ~~Test ExchangeEngine compilation after fixes~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Begin Core project migration
- [ ] Test end-to-end build of all completed projects
