### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED / NEEDS FIXES**

#### **CryptoBot.ExchangeEngine** 🔶
- **Status**: Major API compatibility issues resolved, type conflicts remain
- **✅ FIXED Issues**:
  1. **RestSharp v111 API compatibility** ✅
     - Replaced `RestSharp.Extensions.MonoHttp` with `System.Net.WebUtility`
     - Updated HTTP method enums and async patterns

     - Already using `System.Net.WebSockets.ClientWebSocket`
     - No WebSocketSharp dependencies found
- **❌ REMAINING Issues**:
  1. **Interface conflicts** between Model and ExchangeEngine
     - `ExchangeTicker` class missing or not accessible
     - Multiple interface implementation errors
- **Priority**: HIGH (blocks Core migration)

#### **CryptoBot.Api** 🔶  
- **✅ FIXED Issues**:
  1. **API Versioning** ✅
     - Added `using Asp.Versioning;` to all controllers
     - `ApiVersionAttribute` now recognized
  2. **IHostingEnvironment ambiguity** ✅
     - Updated to use explicit `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment`
- **❌ REMAINING Issues**:
  1. **Missing project references** (temporarily removed)
     - Core and ExchangeEngine commented out until dependencies fixed
     - Some API controllers reference missing types
- **Priority**: LOW (awaiting dependency resolution)

## 🔧 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### 1. **ExchangeTicker Type Resolution** 🔴
**Task**: Fix missing ExchangeTicker class causing interface conflicts
- **Issue**: `ExchangeTicker` referenced in interfaces but class not found
- **Impact**: Blocks ExchangeEngine compilation and Core migration
- **Location**: Interface conflicts between Model and ExchangeEngine projects
- **Priority**: HIGH - This is the main blocker for completing migration

### 2. **Interface Implementation Conflicts** 🔴
**Task**: Resolve duplicate interface definitions
- **Issue**: `IExchangeApi` conflicts between Model and ExchangeEngine
- **Impact**: Multiple CS0535 errors for missing interface members
- **Solution**: Consolidate interface definitions or remove duplicates
- **Priority**: HIGH - Related to ExchangeTicker issue

### ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### ~~1. TALib.NETCore API Research~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Updated to TALib.NETCore v0.5.0 
- ✅ Fixed MACD: `Core.Macd(...)` → `Functions.Macd(...)`
- ✅ Fixed Stochastic: `Core.Stoch(...)` → `Functions.Stoch(...)`
- ✅ IndicatorEngine builds successfully

### ~~2. RestSharp v111 Breaking Changes~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Replaced `RestSharp.Extensions.MonoHttp` with `System.Net.WebUtility`
- ✅ Updated HTTP methods and async patterns
- ✅ Upgraded to secure RestSharp v111.4.1

### ~~3. WebSocket Replacement~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**  
- ✅ Already using `System.Net.WebSockets.ClientWebSocket`
- ✅ No WebSocketSharp dependencies found
- ✅ Modern WebSocket implementation in place

### ~~4. API Versioning Migration~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Added `using Asp.Versioning;` to all controllers
- ✅ Fixed `IHostingEnvironment` ambiguous reference
- ✅ `ApiVersionAttribute` now recognized
